The diffuse direct looks the way it does because the initial light diffusions are hitting off the walls and boxes, and the spheres do not have the diffuse property. The diffuse indirect has some reflected color on the cubes and the top, bottom, and center walls because this light is reflected off of the side walls, which have color properties. These color properties are further evidenced in the diffuse color, and explains why the side walls are completely solid colors. In the diffuse color, the cubes and upper, bottom, and center walls only diffuse some gray, and the spheres don't diffuse at all, so they are black.

The glossy direct only reflects light that initially bounces off the spheres, so there are only two white spots, one for each sphere, representing where the light reflects. However, in the glossy indirect, the light bounces off the walls and other surfaces first, which gives the spheres a more complete reflection of the entire surroundings. However, the sphere to the right is slightly darker, which is reflected in the glossy color pass. In this pass, the sphere to the right is colored slightly darker than the one to the left.

In the transmissive direct, there is only black, because there is nothing reflected transmissively with just one bounce of a light ray. However, the transmissive indirect reveals that the sphere to the right is transmissive and reflects light rays that have bounced off the environment first. The transmissive color pass affirms that only the sphere to the right is transmissive, since it is white and the sphere to the left is covered in the surrounding black.
